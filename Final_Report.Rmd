Idee: vielleicht keine 1-bla Nummerierung, sondern Aufteilung in Phase 1-5 und dann Unterpunkte mit Header2

# 1. Introduction

Cancer, neurological diseases and muscular atrophy - What do these diseases have in common? 
All of them include RNA-binding proteins. RNA-binding proteins (RBP) are proteins that bind RNA and form ribonucleoprotein particles. They are involved in a number of processes like translation, alternative splicing, RNA editing and chemical modification as well as protein modification. RBPs belong to the RNA-dependent proteins (RDP) togehter with RBP-binding proteins. These RBP-binding proteins bind RBPs when they assemble with RNA. Their complex interactions are crucial for cellular functions and therefore it is of importance to identify RDPs.


## 1.1 Summary of experiment
To identify RDPs a proteom-wide screen was conducted with mass-spectometry. HeLa S3 cels in different cell cycle stages were lysed (Fig. 1). The cell lysate was split into a control and an RNase gropup. The RNase group was treated with RNase which causes the degradation of RNase. RBPs can no longer bind to RNA and RBP-binding proteins to RBPs. The control group did not receive any further treatment and therefore all RNA and RDPs interact. The cell lysate was transferred onto a sucrose density gradient. After ultra centrifugation the RNA-protein complexes or proteins alone will end up in one of 25 fractions depending on their molecular weight. A heavy RNA-protein complex will travel further and land in a higher fraction than a single protein from the RNase treatment. This would create a left shift and is expected to happen for RDPs.

## 1.2 Goals
The main goal is to automatically identify RDPs on the basis of the fraction shift between control and RNase treatment. 

# 2. Description of the Dataset
The dataset consists of 4765 rows which represent different proteins and 150 columns. Those include 3 replica for each of the 25 fractions for control and RNase treatment (3 x 25 x 2 = 150 columns). For every protein the protein amount in a certain fraction is given in arbitrary units.

Include graphs before Normalization?

# 3. Data Clean Up and Normalization 
Clean Up is needed to...
Split of Control and RNase group. 
Maybe even more subtables?


# 3.1 Data Clean Up
No missing values -> summary function
Removing of all 0 rows.

## 3.2 Normalization 
Why needed?
Include picture to illustrate method.
Normalization factor... Describe method.
Show barplot before and after. Maybe even distribution.

## 3.3 Scaling
Why needed?
Include formula. 

# 4. Maxima and Gaussian Curve 

## 4.1 Smoothing the Curve


## 4.2 Identification of global Maxima


## 4.3 Gauss fitting to the Curve
